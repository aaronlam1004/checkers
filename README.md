## Installing
Python is required to run and play the game as of now. This was created using [Python 3.7.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/)
<br></br>
Additional Python packages need to be installed which can be seen in `requirements.txt` file.
<br></br>
All of these packages can be installed using:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
## Running
Simply call `python main.py` to run the program after all of the packages have been installed.
## TODO
- [ ] Write comments. 
- [ ] Reorganization (ake abstract Board class, tidy of `game.py`, etc.).
- [ ] Make font not Comic Sans MS.
- [ ] Move limit so that game ends after a certain number of moves without capturing.
- [ ] Finish making the main menu.
- [ ] Multiple modes (standard, casual, international, etc.)
- [ ] Add server and client scripts to make the game playable online.
- [ ] Option to rotate the board when move is complete (not for online).
- [ ] Allow players to choose colors.
- [ ] Improve graphics.
- [ ] Better optimization.
